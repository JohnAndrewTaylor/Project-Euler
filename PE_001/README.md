Problem 1:
"If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000."

The program calculates the sum of all multiples of any whole number (n) within a given non-negative range (A to B). It should be noted that adding the multiples of A and B will not be sufficient, since the numbers that are multiples of A and B will be counted twice (Further reference: General Rule of Addition in Statistics). The answer to Problem 1 can be found by using the range of 0-1000 and finding the sum of the multiples of 3 and 5 and then subtracting the sum of the multiples of 15.
